# Basketball Scoreboard

An elementary scoreboard that will help you quickly calculate the score. Previously, it would have taken a long time, or I wouldn't have understood JS in the beginning. Now created in 2 hours from scratch, without Googling - this is the main achievement ðŸ¥³.

Functionality:
1. By pressing the buttons +1, +2, and +3 you can easily add points to the account;
2. The winning team is highlighted in a different color;
3. By clicking "New Game" the score is reset;

Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
